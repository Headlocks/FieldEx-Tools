Here’s a one-liner script that safely pins Kali packages so they won’t automatically upgrade your Debian system:

✅ One-liner to Add APT Pinning for Kali:

echo -e "Package: *\nPin: release a=kali-rolling\nPin-Priority: 50" | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/kali.pref > /dev/null


⸻

🔍 What this does:
	•	Creates /etc/apt/preferences.d/kali.pref
	•	Sets priority 50 for anything from kali-rolling
	•	Prevents APT from auto-upgrading or installing Kali packages unless you explicitly say so

⸻

✅ Test it worked:

cat /etc/apt/preferences.d/kali.pref

You should see:

Package: *
Pin: release a=kali-rolling
Pin-Priority: 50


⸻

Now you’re safe: you can run sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade and it won’t overwrite Debian packages with Kali versions unless you explicitly do:

sudo apt install <package> -t kali-rolling

Let me know if you’d like a similar script to remove the Kali repo later if needed.
